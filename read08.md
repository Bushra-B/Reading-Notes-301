### Query:

**a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.**

### Schema:

**describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.**
