# SQL

**SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.**

### Query:

** a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.**

### Schema:

**describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.**
