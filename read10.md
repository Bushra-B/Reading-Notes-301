# Call Stack

**a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions**

- **LIFO**: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns

### Temporarily Store:

### Stack Overflow:

**A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point**

### The key takeaways from the call stack are:

1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.
