# Database Normalization

- **a process used to organize a database into tables and columns**
- **a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included**
- **a table should be limited to one purpose by reducing the number of duplicate data contained within our database**

## Benifits of Database Normalization:

1. minimize duplicate data
2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. simplify queries

## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies

- **increases storage and decreases performance**
- **becomes more difficult to maintain data changes**
