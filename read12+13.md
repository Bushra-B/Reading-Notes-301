# EJS Partials

- **for reusing the same HTML across multiple views**  
- **syntax: `<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>`**  
- **creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS, you just have to create the partial files for HTML pieces that you want to reuse, and then just include them in other pages using the syntax**

# Sending form data

## Client/server architecture

- **a client (i.e. web browser) sends a request to a server (web server), using the HTTP protocol** 
- **the server answers the request using the same protocol**

- **An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request**


## Defining how to send the data

- **the `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent**
- **form attributes configure the request***
- **the two most important attributes are `action` and `method`**

### Action Attribute

- **the action attribute defines where the data gets sent** 
- **its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL**
- **if this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form (the current page)**


### Method Attribute

- **the method attribute defines how data is sent**
- **the HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request**
- **HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods**
- **the most common methods are:**  
    - **`GET` method**  
    to ask the server to send back a given resource
    - **`POST` method**  
    to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request
